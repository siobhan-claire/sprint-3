What is your site's primary purpose?
To help me learn how to build a website/personal blog that I can visit to reflect on all the things I have learnt during my time at Dev Academy.

Who is your target audience?
Right now just myself and my cohort but once it's done hopefully potential employers.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have? I want visitors to be impressed with the design of course, but also I want my site to be very tidy and easy to navigate. I want it to be user friendly and attractive.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience? I will make it as minimal as possible and I will use cohesive, responsive design.
